Want to install Flux natively in your GitHub actions? You've come to the right place!
Are you looking for a container base that has flux ready to go? Check our our
[GitHub packages](https://github.com/orgs/flux-framework/packages?repo_name=flux-core) and [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fluxrm/flux-sched).

It is suggested that you use our action releases, which are pinned to have default
versions accordingly, and use the main branch only if you know what you are doing.
